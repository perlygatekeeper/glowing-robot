 BIGINT (8 bytes) is not enough since it maxes out at 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (20 digits).



 does mysql support integer type greater than 8 bytes?


 ChatGPT said:
 No, MySQL does not support an integer type greater than 8 bytes (BIGINT).

 🔍 What If You Need Bigger Integers?
 Store as a DECIMAL Type

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 DECIMAL(65,0)  -- Supports up to 65 digits
 ✅ Can store numbers larger than BIGINT, but slower than integers.

 Store as a VARCHAR (For Arbitrary Precision)

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 VARCHAR(100)  -- Store as a string
 ✅ Allows unlimited size but requires conversion for math operations.

 Use BIGINT UNSIGNED If You Don't Need Negatives

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 BIGINT UNSIGNED
 ✅ Doubles the positive range (up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615).

 primes with up to 70 decimal digits

 If you need to store primes with up to 70 decimal digits, BIGINT (8 bytes) is not enough since it maxes out at 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (20 digits).

 ✅ Best MySQL Data Type for 70-Digit Primes
 1️⃣ Use DECIMAL(70,0) (Exact Precision)
 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 CREATE TABLE primes (
     prime_id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         prime DECIMAL(70,0) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
             sequence INT UNSIGNED UNIQUE NOT NULL
             );
 ✅ Stores up to 70-digit numbers exactly.
 ✅ Supports numeric comparisons and indexing.
 ❌ Slower than integers for calculations.

 2️⃣ Use VARCHAR(70) (String Storage)
 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 CREATE TABLE primes (
     prime_id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         prime VARCHAR(70) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
             sequence INT UNSIGNED UNIQUE NOT NULL
             );
 ✅ Avoids precision issues when using external libraries.
 ✅ Ideal if calculations are handled outside MySQL.
 ❌ Requires conversion for numerical operations.

 🔢 Storing & Retrieving Large Primes
 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 INSERT INTO primes (prime, sequence) VALUES 
 ('9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999', 1);
 ✅ Works for numbers up to 70 digits.

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 SELECT * FROM primes WHERE prime > '1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';
 ✅ String comparisons work correctly, but need indexing for speed.

 🚀 Alternative: Store as Binary for Speed
 If you want efficient storage, consider storing the prime as binary (BLOB):

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 CREATE TABLE primes (
     prime_id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         prime VARBINARY(32) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Stores a 256-bit number
             sequence INT UNSIGNED UNIQUE NOT NULL
             );
 Then, convert to binary in Python before inserting.

 📌 Final Recommendation
 Storage Method Pros    Cons
 DECIMAL(70,0)  Exact math, easy to query       Slower than integers
 VARCHAR(70)    Flexible, avoids precision issues       No direct math operations
 VARBINARY(32)  Compact, optimized      Needs conversion in queries
 Would you like Python code to handle inserting and retrieving 70-digit primes? 🚀

 how does one "convert in queries"
 ChatGPT said:
 If you store large prime numbers in VARCHAR, BLOB, or other non-integer formats, you may need to convert them in queries when performing calculations. Here’s how you can do that in MySQL:

 🔢 1. Convert VARCHAR to Numeric (DECIMAL)
 If primes are stored as VARCHAR(70), you can convert them into a numeric type for comparisons:

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 SELECT * FROM primes 
 WHERE CAST(prime AS DECIMAL(70,0)) > 1000000000000000000000000000000000000;
 ✅ Allows numeric comparisons on VARCHAR data.

 🧑‍💻 2. Convert BLOB or VARBINARY to a String
 If primes are stored as binary (VARBINARY or BLOB), use CAST() to convert them back to a readable format:

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 SELECT CAST(prime AS CHAR) FROM primes;
 ✅ Useful for displaying the stored binary number as text.

 🔄 3. Convert DECIMAL to VARCHAR (String)
 If you need to convert a DECIMAL(70,0) back to a string:

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 SELECT CAST(prime AS CHAR(70)) FROM primes;
 ✅ Allows storing and displaying large primes as text.

 🛠 4. Convert HEX to Integer (If Using VARBINARY)
 If you store primes in hexadecimal format, you can retrieve them as integers:

 sql
 Copy
 Edit
 SELECT CONV(HEX(prime), 16, 10) AS prime_number FROM primes;
 ✅ Retrieves stored binary values as decimal numbers.

 🚀 Final Thoughts
 Stored Format  Conversion Needed       Example Query
 VARCHAR(70)    Convert to DECIMAL      CAST(prime AS DECIMAL(70,0))
 DECIMAL(70,0)  Convert to VARCHAR      CAST(prime AS CHAR(70))
 VARBINARY(32)  Convert to HEX  HEX(prime)
 BLOB   Convert to String       CAST(prime AS CHAR)
 Would you like Python code to handle these conversions automatically? 🚀
