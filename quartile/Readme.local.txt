     Quartile is a new game found on the New York Times.

     It consists of 20 2-4-character syllables, from which all
     words possible should be found.

     The 20 syllables will be able to make 5 4-syllable words
     but also many words from 1 to 3 syllables as well.

     Each syllable seems to contain either 2, 3 or 4 characters.

     The 4-syllable prizes, therefore, will be between 8 an 12 characters.

     I will there for be first finding all such words.
