   The Inkscape SVG file has 4 layers

   1) Sensors (the rainbow colored triangles)

      Each sensor's color was set using HSV and setting the Hue manually
      rough names for these colors were choosen to name each sensor objects,
      as follows:
      Hue  Color name  Sensor angle
      120  green         0
      160  green        40
      200  green        80
      240  green       120
      280  green       160
      320  green       200
        0  green       240
       40  green       280
       80  green       320

     The sensors were distributed around a circle using Inkscape's
     Align and Distribute tool
     Circular tab
     Anchor point: Objects' rotational centers
     Arrange on:   Parameterized:
     Center X/Y: 90  90  px
     Radius X/Y: 59  59  px
     Angle  X/Y:  0 360  degrees 

     Each Sensor object was then moved manually to have it's point just touch the inner 
     portion of the Track circle.

   2) Degrees Text
      Containing the text indicating the clockwise rotation of the Arcs in degrees
      Starting with
       o
      0

      Font: Black, monospace, normal, 9.375 pt

   3) Bits Display
      Rainbow colored text consisting of 0's and 1's
      centered horizontally and slightly below center vertically
      Each bit is 1 if the corresponding colored sensor's points is
      inside one of the black tracks.

      Font: Rainbow (matching Sensor colors), monospace, normal, 10 pt

   4) Arcs
      Arcs of a circle representing tracks (black) and the spaces inbetween
      the tracks (white).  Only the tracks are drawn, utilizing Inkscape's
      Draw a Ellipse, Circle or Arc tool, then manually setting the start
      and end angles of the arc in degrees and choosing an arc WITHOUT
      radius lines from the circle's center to both the starting point
      and ending point of each arc.
