Digit factorials

 Problem 34
 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

 Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

 Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

Notes:

What are the limits where a number CAN be the sum of it's digits.

         Expansion      
         Value

 0!           0
 1!           1
 2!           2
 3!           6
 4!          24
 5!         120
 6!         720
 7!       5,040
 8!      40,320
 9!     362,880
10!   3,628,800

The maxium sum of digit factorials will grow linearly with the number of digits
in the number.

for a number with d digits:

  d       number   Sum of Factorial of digits
  1            9    1 * 362,880  =    362,880
  2           99    2 * 362,880  =    725,760
  3          999    3 * 362,880  =  1,088,640
  4        9,999    4 * 362,880  =  1,451,520
  5       99,999    5 * 362,880  =  1,814,400
  6      999,999    6 * 362,880  =  2,177,280
  7    9,999,999    7 * 362,880  =  2,540,160   <- after 7 digits it's no longer possible for
                                                   sum of digit factorials to equal the number
  8   99,999,999    8 * 362,880  =  2,903,040
  9  999,999,999    9 * 362,880  =  3,265,920

  2,999,999    2 + 6 * 362,880  =  2,177,282    <- ~3,000,000 is also too large to be equal
                                                   the sum of it's digit's factorials
