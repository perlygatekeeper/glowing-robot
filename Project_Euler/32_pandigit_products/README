Pandigital products

 Problem 32
 We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
 digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1
 through 5 pandigital.

 The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
 multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

 Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
 can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

 HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
 include it once in your sum.

Notes:

m x M = P

1 x M = P  <- can never work, since M and P  will have same digits

9876543 is largest number that will leave 2 digits to make up m and M:

Real largest product will be much smaller:

 1 x    10 =     10 <- too few digits
 9 x    99 =    891 <- too few digits
 9 x   999 =   8991 <- too few digits
 1 x  1000 =   1000 <- 9 digit possible   1, 4 and 4
 9 x  9999 =  89991 <- 9 digit possible
 1 x 10000 =  10000 <- too many digits

    2 -    9 =>    8 1-digit numbers  
 1234 - 9876 => 8643 4-digit numbers
-------------------------------------------
 10 x  10   =    100   
 99 x  99   =   9801 <- too few digits
 10 x  100  =   1000 <- 9 digit possible 2, 3 and 4
 99 x  999  =  98901 <- 9 digit possible
 10 x 1000  =  10000 <- too many digits

   12 -  98 =>   87  2-digit numbers
  123 - 987 =>  865  3-digit numbers
-------------------------------------------

100 x 100 =  10000 <- too many digits
999 x 999 = 998001 <- too many digits
-------------------------------------------

Digits   Digits    Digits 
1             4         5

2             3         4
2             3         4

3             1         4
3             1         4

3             1         4



Solution:


    2 -    9 =>    8 1-digit numbers  
 1234 - 9876 => 8643 4-digit numbers
   12 -  98 =>   87  2-digit numbers
  123 - 987 =>  865  3-digit numbers
