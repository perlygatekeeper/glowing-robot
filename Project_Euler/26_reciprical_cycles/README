Reciprocal cycles

 Problem 26
 A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the
 unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

 1/2    =       0.5
 1/3    =       0.(3)
 1/4    =       0.25
 1/5    =       0.2
 1/6    =       0.1(6)
 1/7    =       0.(142857)
 1/8    =       0.125
 1/9    =       0.(1)
 1/10   =       0.1
 Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be
 seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

 Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle
 in its decimal fraction part.

Notes:

All numbers with prime factors of only 2 and/or 5 will terminate their decimal
representation.

Eliminate all powers of just 2 and 5 between 2 and 999
