Amicable numbers

  Problem 21
  Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
  If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

  For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

  Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

Notes:

Use my PFN routine and add a routine to make all the proper factors.

Store all numbers and their "sums of proper divisors in dictionary "d".

loop over all numbers 1 ... 10,000 and increment counter if d[d[number]] == number

Note that 6 and 28 are amicable with themselves, but not included in the sum.


Solution:

The number of amicable numbers below 10000 is 10 which sum to 31626 and this took 0.665538 seconds to find.
