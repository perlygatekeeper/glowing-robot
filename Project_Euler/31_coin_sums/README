Coin sums

 Problem 31
 In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p).
 There are eight coins in general circulation:

 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
 It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
 How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

Notes:

Will follow a odometer type solution

   L2    L1  50p  20p  10p   5p   2p   1p
    1     0    0    0    0    0    0    0   <- one solution
    0     2    0    0    0    0    0    0   <- another solution
    0     0    4    0    0    0    0    0   <- yet another solution
    0     0    0    0    0    0    0  200   <- last solution

Solution:
