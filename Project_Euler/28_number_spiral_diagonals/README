Number spiral diagonals

 Problem 28
 Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

 21 22 23 24 25     21 + 25 = 46
 20  7  8  9 10      7 +  9 = 16
 19  6  1  2 11           1 =  1
 18  5  4  3 12      5 +  3 =  8
 17 16 15 14 13     17 + 13 = 30

 It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

 What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

N = 0, 1, 2

Size of Square is 2N + 1

Sum: four numbers   upper right is (2N+1)^2                4N^2  + 4N  + 1
                    lower right is (2(N-1)+1)^2 + 2N       4N^2  - 2N  + 1
                    lower  left is above + 2N              4N^2        + 1
                    upper  left is above + 2N              4N^2  + 2N  + 1
                                                          16N^2  + 4N  + 4 = 4 (N+1)^2

N   16N^2  + 4N  + 4
0   0 + 4N +4   = N/A
1   16 + 4 +4   = 24   (6*4)
