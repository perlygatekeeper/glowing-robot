Quadratic primes

  Problem 27
  Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

  n^2 + n + 41

  It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 ≤ n ≤ 39.

  However, when n=40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40 ( 40 + 1 ) + 41 is divisible by 41,
  and certainly when n=41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

  The incredible formula n^2 − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0 ≤ n ≤ 79.
  The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

  Considering quadratics of the form:

  n^2 + a*n + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| ≤ 1000

  where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n e.g. |11|=11 and |−4|=4

  Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression
  that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n,
  starting with n = 0.

Notes:

whne n = 0  ->  n^2 + a*n + b = b           therefore b must be a positive prime number.
when n = 1  ->  n^2 + a*n + b = 1 + a + b   since when (a + b) must be even

b = 2
for a in range(-1000,1001,2):      # b is even so a must be even for (a+b) to be even
for b in primes_less_than_1000:    # there are 167 such primes where 2 < P < 1000
    for a in range(-999,1000,2):   # b is  odd so a must be  odd for (a+b) to be even
  
Solution:
