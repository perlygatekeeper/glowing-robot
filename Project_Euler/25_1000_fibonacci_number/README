  Problem 25
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

  Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
  Hence the first 12 terms will be:

  F1 = 1
  F2 = 1
  F3 = 2
  F4 = 3
  F5 = 5
  F6 = 8
  F7 = 13
  F8 = 21
  F9 = 34
  F10 = 55
  F11 = 89
  F12 = 144
  The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

  What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?


Notes:

Closed-form expression
Like every sequence defined by a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, the Fibonacci numbers have a closed-form solution. It has become known as "Binet's formula", though it was already known by Abraham de Moivre and Daniel Bernoulli:[50]

Fn   =   ( phi^n - psi^n ) / ( phi - psi )  =  ( phi^n - psi^n ) / sqrt(5)

where

phi  =  ( 1 + sqrt(5) ) / 2                             approx 1.61803 39887 ...

is the golden ratio (OEIS: A001622), and

psi  =  ( 1 - sqrt(5) ) / 2  =   1 - phi =  -1 / phi    approx -0.61803 39887 ...

Since ( psi = -phi^(-1)}, this formula can also be written as

Fn   =  ( ( phi^n - (-phi)^-n ) / sqrt(5)  =   ( ( phi^n - (-phi)^-n ) / ( 2 phi - 1 )

Solution:
