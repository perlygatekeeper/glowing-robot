   I carry a collection of natural tokens, each imbued with the whispers of the spirits I serve.

   Amara, the protector of both the whispering forests and bustling cities, has
   mastered the primal energies of nature. Her arrows fly with unerring accuracy,
   and her connection to the land grants her wisdom and healing power, earning her
   the reverence of both nature and civilization.
