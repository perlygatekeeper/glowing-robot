  Brian,

  This is my scramble/encryption script.   It works by reading the input 8 bytes at a
  time then transforming the block, with many seperate transforms.  An example transform
  would be flipping (reversing) each byte in the 8-byte block.

  When unscrambling, these transforms are undone, in reverse order, thus restoring the
  orginal input.

  To complete the transforms, each block needs to be 8 bytes long.  The last block can
  have anywhere between 1 and 8 bytes depending on the length of the original input.
  The last block is, therefore, padded with Null bytes to 8 bytes.

  As there is no way to know what the size of the last block was, I've decided to leave
  the padding Null bytes in the unscrambled output.

  Can you decipher how my script works?  There is a Notes.txt files which explains
  much of it?

  Steve
