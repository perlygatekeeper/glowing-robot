Hi Steve,

I was able to unscramble message. You mention a Notes.txt file in your message
and code, but it wasn't included with the other attachments.

I took a quick look at the code, but my brain is too tired to try and make
sense of it at this hour.

Did you write this all from scratch or leverage ChatGPT or Bard/Gemini for
help? I've been experimenting with LLMs locally using LM Studio:

A few models even work on my CMM MacBook (M1 Pro, 16 GB) as long as I stick to
smaller 7B parameter models. There's one called Deepseek Coder that handles
Python pretty well:

I finally saw Dune Part 1 today. Better than expected, very good. I look
forward to the release of Part 2 next month.

Later,

Steve
