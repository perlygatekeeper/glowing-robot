Stephen,


I did you Bard when I got stuck and for some debugging help but yes it was from scratch.

I doubt Bard would be able to do this.

I will attach the Notes.txt file but scrambled.

I sent this to 6 people but only you have been able to unscramble it so far.


As per the security of this script...

1) it's on github, so no security

2) it's more meant to keep google from harvesting anything from my emails.

3) it can be combined with OTP and/or public/private keys, as another layer of security.
