Again the triangle numbers rear their ugly heads!

with 2,000,000,001 employee ids the longest line length that will potentially be
complete (end with a line where only the lead employee is noted for the checksum)
is the index of the largest triangle number less than or equal to 2,000,000,001.

T(n) = n ( n + 1 ) / 2

     ~= sqrt(2,000,000,001) / 2

n^2 / 2 = 2,000,000,001
n^2 = 4,000,000,002
n = sqrt(4,000,000,002)

OK THAT'S WRONG!   Forgot to count the employees that will not be noted:

Answer is far simplier as we have to make a square

   1    2    3    4 /   line = 0
   5    6    7 /  8     line = 1
   9   10 / 11   12     line = 2
  13 / 14   15   16     line = 3


   1    2    3    4    5 /
   6    7    8    9 / 10
  11   12   13 / 14   15
  16   17 / 18   19   20
  21 / 22   23   24   25


ceil ( sqrt ( 2,000,000,001 )

Input [4.58257569495584] 2000000001
Input [2000000001] sqrt
Input [44721.3595611761] 

44722

this is the largest line then, that when starting at id 0 or with wrapping
(both cases will lead to all 2,000,000,001 employees being in line) 
that will lead to the last line having only the lead of the line noted for
the checksum.  All line lengths bigger will end with a line with more
than one employee's id counted.
