using return of None to cause failure for
either length <=> THRESHOLD
or     start <=> THRESHOLD
or both  I was able to determine:

Test  1 passed!           start =     0 & length = 3
Test  2 failed            start =    17 & length = 4
Test  3 failed  [Hidden]  start =   999 & length = 10000
Test  4 passed! [Hidden]  start =   999 & length = 1
Test  5 failed  [Hidden]  start = 12941 & length = 44693
Test  6 failed  [Hidden]  start = 63682 & length = 44587
Test  7 failed  [Hidden]  start =   999 & length = 1000
Test  8 failed  [Hidden]  start =   999 & length = 100
Test  9 failed  [Hidden]  start =     0 & length = 44721
Test 10 failed  [Hidden]  start =   999 & length = 10
