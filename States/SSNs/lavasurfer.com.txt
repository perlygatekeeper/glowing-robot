How to Decipher a Social Security Number

This information isn't really a secret. It just isn't very well known.
According to the Social Security Administration, your nine-digit Social
Security Number (SSN) is divided into three parts:

1. The first three digits are known as the "area number". Until June 25, 2011,
this is generally the State or territory where your SSN was assigned.
Thereafter, the number was randomly assigned.

2. The second two numbers are known as the "group numbers". They really do not
have any geographical or data significance.

3. The third set of four numbers is simply the numerical sequence of digits
0001 to 9999 issued within each group.

By using the first three numbers of anyone's SSN, you can often tell in which
State they were born, or at the least, one of the States where they once lived.
Try it!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Notes:

1) * = 700-728 issuance of these numbers to railroad employees was discontinued
July 1, 1963.

2) If the same area number appears above more than once, it is because certain
numbers were transferred from one State to another or that the area number was
divided for use amongst certain geographical locations.

3) Any number beginning with "000", "666", "900-999", has a middle "00", or
ends in "0000" will never be a valid SSN.

4) Originally, the first three digits were assigned by the geographical region
in which the person was residing at the time the number was assigned.
"Generally, numbers were assigned beginning in the northeast and moved
westward. So people on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the
west coast had the highest numbers".

5) Since 1972/1973, when SSA started assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally
from Baltimore, the Area Number assigned has been based on the ZIP code in the
mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security
card. The applicant's mailing address does not have to be the same as their
place of birth or residence. Prior to 1972/1973, social security numbers were
assigned by field offices. Therefore, the Area Number does not necessarily
represent the State of residence of the applicant, either prior to 1972/1973 or
since.

6) People born in the United States since 1987 may have had their SSN applied
for them by the hospital at birth. This policy varies by State.

7) Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA began a new randomized assignment
methodology, called "SSN Randomization", in an effort to extend the longevity
of the nine-digit SSN nationwide as well as for security since randomization
makes the newly assigned SSN's more difficult to reconstruct using public
information. Unused area numbers previously assigned to states, as well as
previously unassigned area numbers, will now be available in the new
randomization system.

8) Numbers in red were originally assigned to these states but were
subsequently unassigned come June 2011 and used in the new randomized
assignment. Numbers in these "officially" unissued series may still have been
issued for applicants in these states prior to randomization.

9) Social Security Numbers are never reassigned after someone dies. Despite
issuing over 450 million SSN's since 1936, and assigning about 5.5 million new
numbers a year, they can still issue new numbers for several generations.
