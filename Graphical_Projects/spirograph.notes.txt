The Spirograph is based on the equations for hypotrochoids and epitrochoids:

x= (R − r) cos(θ) + d cos( θ (R−r)/r )
y= (R − r) sin(θ) − d sin( θ (R−r)/r )

Where:

R = Radius of the fixed outer circle
r = Radius of the rolling inner circle
d = Distance of the drawing point from the center of the rolling circle
θ = Angle of rotation
